# Simulating-Kalman-Filtering
Assignment for ROB301 Robotics Course Assignment Implementing Kalman Filtering and demonstrating its limitations
The Kalman Filter seems to be ineffective in this simulation. 
After running the program multiple times, there is no clear indication that the standard deviation of the Kalman Filter is any different than results without Kalman Filter. 
This is likely due to the noise added to the measurement to state position transformation. 
This standard deviation was calculated with respect to the zero noise solution.
